# PolyRythm-using-MultiThreading
Have you ever wondered how to create complex and captivating musical patterns with code? This repository shows you how to use multi-threading in Python to produce polyrhythms - rhythms that combine two or more different meters or pulses. By using two thread classes, "mrunnable.java" and "nrunnable.java", you can play two distinct rhythms on separate CPU cores, creating a rich and harmonious sound.
